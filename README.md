<h2><strong>Course Overview:</strong></h2>
<ul>This course introduces students to the real world challenges of implementing machine learning based trading strategies 
including the algorithmic steps from information gathering to market orders. The focus is on how to apply probabilistic 
machine learning approaches to trading decisions. We consider statistical approaches like linear regression, Q-Learning, 
KNN and regression trees and how to apply them to actual stock trading situations.</ul>
<ul>This course is composed of three mini-courses:</ul>
<ul>Mini-course 1: Manipulating Financial Data in Python</ul>
<ul>Mini-course 2: Computational Investing</ul>
<ul>Mini-course 3: Machine Learning Algorithms for Trading</ul>
